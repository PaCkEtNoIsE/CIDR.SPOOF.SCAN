# CIDR.SPOOF.SCAN
👽 Unleashes a storm of legitimate looking traffic in order to congest, invalidate, and annoy threat intelligence sensors such as GreyNoise and SpamHaus.

By default it will scan only port 10101.
If you want to change the port edit file main.go at line 34: ports = []int{10101}

If you want to scan multiple ports edit file main.go at line 34: ports = []int{21,22,23}
```
